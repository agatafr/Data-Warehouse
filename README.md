# Data-Warehouse
The data warehouse was designed to analyze students' performance and attendance. The project included creating a data generator, collecting data in Microsoft SQL Server databases and carrying out the ETL process using Microsoft Visual Studio tools, SQL language and a data warehouse created in the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Additionally, the project included designing MDX queries, data analysis and presentation of results in Microsoft Power BI

Project Components
1. ETL
   
The ETL folder contains scripts and files related to the Extract, Transform, and Load processes. This critical step involves extracting data from various sources, transforming it according to predefined rules, and loading it into the data warehouse. The scripts are implemented using Microsoft Visual Studio tools and SQL language.

3. ETLSCHOOLDW
   
The ETLSCHOOLDW folder specifically focuses on the school data warehouse implementation within the Microsoft Visual Studio. This section includes all the necessary files and configurations for creating and managing the data warehouse environment.

5. MDX Queries
   
The MDX folder houses scripts for Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) queries. These queries play a vital role in retrieving and analyzing data stored in the multidimensional data warehouse. The MDX queries are designed to provide valuable insights into students' performance and attendance.

7. Generator
   
The Generator folder contains Python scripts responsible for generating sample data. This is crucial for testing and development purposes. Additionally, exemplary output files with SQL inserts are included, showcasing the generated data that can be used to populate the database.

9. POWER BI
    
The POWER BI folder encompasses files and configurations related to data analysis and visualization using Microsoft Power BI. This tool is utilized for creating interactive and insightful reports based on the data stored in the warehouse.

11. Requirements
    
The Requirements folder includes essential project documents, such as the project specification and the SQL file for creating the school database. These documents provide a detailed understanding of the project goals, scope, and technical requirements.

13. School Implementation for ETL (in Visual Studio)
    
The School Implementation folder within Visual Studio contains the specific implementation of ETL processes tailored to the school data. It includes project files, configurations, and any additional documentation related to the ETL implementation.
